# Use Case Diagrams: Functional Requirement Modeling

## 1. Overview and Purpose
A **Use Case Diagram** is a behavioral UML diagram that describes a set of actions (Use Cases) performed by a system in collaboration with one or more external users (Actors). It serves as a high-level visual representation of a system's functional requirements.

* **Primary Purpose:** To help stakeholders and development teams visualize the functional requirements, the scope of the system, and the relationships between actors and essential processes.
* **User Perspective:** It answers "What does the system do?" from the user's point of view.
* **Scoping:** It defines the system's "Black Box" behavior. By identifying what is inside the diagram, it simultaneously clarifies the system's boundaries and defines what the system will **NOT** do.

## 2. Core Components



### System Boundary
Represented by a **rectangle** enclosing the use cases. It defines the scope of the system. Anything inside the box is part of the system being developed; anything outside is an external entity.

### Actors
Represented by a **stick figure**. An actor represents a *role* played by a user or another system that interacts with the subject.

* **Primary Actors:** Usually placed on the left. They initiate the interaction to achieve a goal.
* **Secondary/Supporting Actors:** Usually placed on the right. They provide a service to the system (e.g., a Database, an Email Server, or a Payment Gateway).

### Use Cases
Represented by an **oval**. A use case represents a discrete unit of business functionality.

* **Naming Convention:** Must start with a **verb** followed by a **noun** (e.g., `Withdraw Cash`, `Generate Report`).
* **Observable Result:** Every use case must provide a measurable value to an actor.

## 3. Relationships

Relationships define how actors and use cases interact.



| Relationship       | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :----------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Association**    | Basic       | A solid line connecting an actor to a use case. Indicates that the actor participates in the use case.                                                                                    |
| **Include**        | Mandatory   | A dashed arrow with the `<<include>>` stereotype. Indicates that the base use case **requires** the functionality of another (e.g., `Login` is included in `View Account`).               |
| **Extend**         | Optional    | A dashed arrow with the `<<extend>>` stereotype. Indicates a use case that adds behavior to a base use case under specific conditions (e.g., `Calculate Late Fee` extends `Return Book`). |
| **Generalization** | Inheritance | A solid line with a hollow arrowhead. Used when a use case or actor is a specialized version of another (e.g., `Credit Card Payment` is a specialization of `Make Payment`).              |

## 4. Relationship Details: Include vs. Extend

In modern design, the direction of the arrow and the "base" logic are the most frequent points of confusion:

* **`<<include>>` (Dependency):** The base use case cannot be completed without the included one. The arrow points **from** the base **to** the included use case. It is used for extracting common parts of behaviors.
* **`<<extend>>` (Variation):** The base use case is complete on its own. The extension only triggers at a defined **Extension Point**. The arrow points **from** the extension **to** the base use case.

## 5. Use Case Specification (The Narrative)
A diagram alone is rarely enough. In a professional setting, each use case in the diagram is backed by a **Use Case Specification** document containing:

1.  **Actor:** Who is involved.
2.  **Pre-conditions:** What must be true before the use case starts.
3.  **Basic Flow (Happy Path):** The standard successful sequence of events.
4.  **Alternative Flows:** Deviations from the happy path.
5.  **Post-conditions:** The state of the system after execution.

## 6. Modern Perspective: Use Cases vs. User Stories
In current **Agile (2026)** environments, developers often debate Use Cases vs. User Stories:

* **User Stories** focus on the "Why" and the value (`As a..., I want..., So that...`). They are intended for quick iteration.
* **Use Cases** focus on the "What" and the "How" (interaction steps). They are better for complex systems where detailed requirements and edge cases must be mapped out early.
