# UML Activity Diagrams: Modeling Process and Workflow

![summary](../../assets/images/Low%20Level%20Design/UML/Activity%20Diagrams/summary.jpg)

## 1. Overview
An **Activity Diagram** is a behavioral UML diagram used to illustrate the dynamic flow of control within a system. While a Sequence Diagram focuses on object interactions, an Activity Diagram emphasizes the **flow of activities**, logic branching, and concurrent processes.

* **Process Modeling:** Captures the step-by-step workflow of business processes or software algorithms.
* **Use Case Realization:** Frequently used to map out the "Basic Flow" and "Alternative Flows" of a specific Use Case.
* **Functional Modeling:** Represents the transformation of data (inputs) through a sequence of operations into outputs.

## 2. Core Components and Notation



### Nodes
* **Initial Node:** A solid black circle representing the start of the workflow.
* **Activity/Action Node:** A rounded rectangle representing a specific task or operation. An action should be an atomic unit of work (e.g., "Validate Password").
* **Final Activity Node:** A "bullseye" (a solid circle inside another circle) representing the end of the entire process.
* **Flow/Edge:** An arrowed line showing the direction of control flow from one node to another.

## 3. Control Logic: Branching and Concurrency

Activity Diagrams excel at showing complex logic that involves decisions or simultaneous tasks.

### Decisions and Merges
* **Decision Node:** A diamond with one incoming flow and multiple outgoing flows. Each outgoing flow has a **Guard Condition** (e.g., `[is_valid]`) in brackets.
* **Merge Node:** A diamond with multiple incoming flows and one outgoing flow. It brings different logic paths back together.

### Concurrency (Fork and Join)
This is a critical distinction from standard flowcharts, allowing the modeling of parallel processing.



* **Fork:** A heavy horizontal or vertical black bar with one incoming flow and multiple outgoing flows. It indicates that the subsequent activities happen **simultaneously** or in any order.
* **Join:** A heavy black bar with multiple incoming flows and one outgoing flow. All parallel activities must reach this bar before the process can continue.

## 4. Swimlanes (Partitions)
**Swimlanes** are used to group activities based on **who** is performing them (e.g., "Customer," "Web Server," "Database"). 

* They are represented as vertical or horizontal columns.
* By placing an action node within a specific swimlane, you clearly define the responsibility or ownership of that task.

## 5. Activity vs. State Machine Diagrams
It is common to confuse these two behavioral diagrams:

* **Activity Diagram:** Focuses on the **flow of work** and the sequence of actions. It is driven by the completion of the previous task.
* **State Machine Diagram:** Focuses on the **life cycle of an object** and how it reacts to external events (e.g., a "Ticket" moving from `Open` to `Resolved`).

## 6. Modern Perspective (2026)
* **BPMN Alignment:** In modern business analysis, Activity Diagrams are often seen as a technical subset of **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)**.
* **Workflow Engines:** These diagrams serve as the logical foundation for modern "low-code" workflow engines and CI/CD pipeline visualizations.
* **Agile Integration:** Teams use Activity Diagrams to map out complex "User Stories" that involve multiple conditional paths or background processing that isn't visible in a UI mockup.
