# UML Sequence Diagrams: Modeling Dynamic Interactions

## 1. Overview
A **Sequence Diagram** is an interaction diagram that illustrates how objects communicate in a specific order over time. It provides a detailed, step-by-step flow of a specific use case or a sub-process within a system.

* **Primary Focus:** The chronological order of messages.
* **Scope:** Often used to model the logic of a single use case, a specific method implementation, or an API request-response cycle.
* **Clarity:** While often described as "self-explanatory," their power lies in their ability to visualize complex logic that would be difficult to follow in raw code.

## 2. Dimensions of a Sequence Diagram
A sequence diagram is mapped onto a 2D grid:

1.  **The Vertical Dimension (Time):** Represents the passage of time from top to bottom. Messages placed lower on the diagram occur after those placed higher.
2.  **The Horizontal Dimension (Participants):** Represents the different **Lifelines** (Actors or Object Instances) involved in the interaction.

## 3. Core Components



### Lifelines and Actors
* **Actors:** Represented by a stick figure; these are external entities (users or other systems) initiating the sequence.
* **Objects/Participants:** Represented by a rectangle containing the object and/or class name. A dashed vertical line (the **Lifeline**) extends downward from the participant.

### Activation Bars (Execution Occurrences)
Represented by a thin rectangle on top of a lifeline. It indicates the period during which an object is performing an operation or is "active."

### Message Types
Messages are the arrows that carry information between lifelines.

| Message Type     | Notation                  | Description                                                                           |
| :--------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Synchronous**  | Solid line + Filled Arrow | The sender waits for a response before continuing.                                    |
| **Asynchronous** | Solid line + Open Arrow   | The sender continues without waiting for a response (common in event-driven systems). |
| **Return**       | Dashed line + Open Arrow  | Indicates the completion of a task and the return of control/data to the caller.      |
| **Self-Message** | U-turn Arrow              | An object calling one of its own methods.                                             |

## 4. Interaction Fragments (Combined Fragments)
In modern UML (2.x), we use **Frames** to represent logic like loops and conditionals. This prevents the diagram from becoming a messy "spaghetti" of arrows.

| Fragment   | Meaning      | Usage                                                                      |
| :--------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`alt`**  | Alternatives | Models "If-Then-Else" logic. Only one operand executes.                    |
| **`opt`**  | Option       | Models "If" logic. The sequence inside happens only if a condition is met. |
| **`loop`** | Iteration    | Models "For" or "While" logic. The sequence repeats.                       |
| **`par`**  | Parallel     | Logic that happens simultaneously across different lifelines.              |

## 5. Modern Best Practices (2026)

### Diagram-as-Code
Rather than drawing these manually, current industry standards prefer using **Diagram-as-Code** tools like **Mermaid.js**, **PlantUML**, or **WebSequenceDiagrams**. This allows sequence diagrams to be version-controlled in Git alongside the source code.

### Level of Detail

* **Conceptual Level:** Focus on high-level business logic.
* **Implementation Level:** Map directly to class methods and API endpoints. 
> **Tip:** Avoid over-modeling. If a sequence diagram looks like a literal translation of the code, it may be too detailed. Focus on the *interactions* that are non-obvious.
