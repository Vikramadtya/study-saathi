# UML Class Diagrams: Static Structure Modeling

![summary](../../assets/images/Low%20Level%20Design/UML/Class%20Diagram/summary.jpg)

## 1. Overview
A **Class Diagram** is a structural UML diagram that describes the static structure of a system. It shows the classes, their attributes, operations (methods), and the relationships among objects.

* **Code Mapping:** It is the only UML diagram that can be mapped directly to object-oriented (OO) languages (Java, C#, C++, etc.), making it the "blueprints" for software construction.
* **Purpose:** To visualize the data model and the functional capabilities of the system's components.

## 2. Class Representation
A class is depicted as a rectangle divided into three horizontal sections:



1.  **Top Section:** The class name (e.g., `Flight`). It should be bold and centered.
2.  **Middle Section:** The class properties/attributes (data).
3.  **Lower Section:** The class operations/methods (functionality).

### Visibility (Access Modifiers)
In modern standards, you must denote the visibility of attributes and methods using these symbols:

* `+` : **Public** (Visible to all)
* `-` : **Private** (Visible only within the class)
* `#` : **Protected** (Visible to the class and its subclasses)
* `~` : **Package/Internal** (Visible within the same package)

## 3. Relationships and Navigation

Relationships define how classes interact and hold references to one another.

### Association
A solid line representing a structural link between two classes.

* **Bidirectional:** A simple solid line. Both classes are aware of each other.
* **Unidirectional:** A solid line with an open arrow. Only the "source" class knows about the "target."

### Multiplicity (Cardinality)
Multiplicity specifies the range of permitted instances that can participate in a relationship.



| Multiplicity  | Meaning                      |
| :------------ | :--------------------------- |
| `1`           | Exactly one                  |
| `0..1`        | Zero or one (Optional)       |
| `*` or `0..*` | Zero to many                 |
| `1..*`        | One to many                  |
| `2..4`        | Specific range (Two to four) |

### Aggregation vs. Composition
Both model a "Whole-to-Part" relationship, but their lifecycles differ significantly.



* **Aggregation (Weak "Has-A"):** Denoted by a **hollow diamond** at the "whole" end. The part can exist independently of the whole (e.g., a Library and its Books). If the Library is deleted, the Books remain.
* **Composition (Strong "Has-A"):** Denoted by a **filled (black) diamond** at the "whole" end. The part’s lifecycle is tied to the whole (e.g., a Room in a House). If the House is destroyed, the Rooms cease to exist.

### Generalization (Inheritance)

Denoted by a **solid line with a hollow triangular arrowhead** pointing to the superclass. This represents an "Is-A" relationship where a subclass inherits the state and behavior of a parent class.

### Dependency (Usage)
Denoted by a **dashed line with an open arrowhead**. It represents a "Uses" relationship. If the supplier class changes, the client class may be affected (e.g., a class using another as a temporary local variable or parameter).

## 4. Interfaces and Abstract Classes

### Abstract Classes
Identified by **italicizing** the class name or adding the `<<abstract>>` stereotype. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.

### Interfaces
An interface defines a contract of behavior. Interfaces are implemented using **Realization**.

* **Notation:** A **dashed line with a hollow triangular arrowhead** (Realization) or the "lollipop" notation.
* **Stereotype:** The name is usually preceded by `<<interface>>`.

## 5. Advanced Annotations

* **Static Members:** To denote a static attribute or method (one that belongs to the class itself rather than an instance), the text is **underlined**.
* **Derived Attributes:** An attribute that can be calculated from other attributes (like `age` from `birthDate`) is prefixed with a forward slash (`/age`).
* **Notes/Comments:** Represented as a rectangle with a folded corner, connected to the relevant class by a dashed line.
